# Cargo Owners - Master Repository

This repository is the main access point for both the Frontend and Backend of this project.

## Cargo Owners | Frontend

The frontend consists of the following:

1. ReactJS - Used to build web application
2. NodeJS - Development server
3. TailwindCSS - For pre-built styles
4. React-Bootstrap - For pre-built components
5. Netlify - CI/CD Integration and Hosting
6. Figma - For mock-up designs | [Link](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1042466647808574080/Cargo-Owners)
7. Production URI - [Link](https://cargo-owners-fe.netlify.app/)

## Cargo Owners | Backend

The backend consists of the following:

1. ExpressJS - Used to build Web API
2. MongoDB - Utilized for storing User, Transporter and Averages Data
3. Heroku - CI/CD Integration and Hosting
4. Production URI - [Link](https://cargo-owners-api.herokuapp.com/)

## Retrospectives

1. Don't implement a separate Backend build and instead integrate the Backend functionality into the Frontend directly
